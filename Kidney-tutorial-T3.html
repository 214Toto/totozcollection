                "the kidney contains baroreceptors (pressure receptors) that contribute to the regulation of cardiac output", 
                "renal blood flow is relatively constant over a wide range of systemic arterial pressures", 
                "renal blood flow is not affected by activation of the sympathetic nerves that innervate the kidney", 
                "a combination of both C and D above"],
                correctAnswer: "renal blood flow is relatively constant over a wide range of systemic arterial pressures",
                explanation: "Renal autoregulation means the kidney maintains a relatively constant blood flow despite changes in systemic arterial pressure. This ensures stable kidney function, particularly in regulating the filtration of blood.",

                "None"],
                correctAnswer: "None",
                explanation: "While nerves play a role in many body systems, they do not regulate key functions like the Na-K-ATPase pump, autoregulation, or urine tonicity directly in the kidney",
            },

                question: "Kidney inflammation may result in the appearance of albumin (a plasma protein) in the urine because",

                "remains constant"],
                correctAnswer: "decreases",

                question: "Urea has a higher concentration in the fluid that leaves the proximal tubule (and enters the loop of Henle) than in blood plasma because",

                "urea is secreted into the proximal tubule", 
                "urea is reabsorbed from the proximal tubule but at a lesser rate that water is reabsorbed", 
                "urea diffuses back into the proximal tubule because of the high urea concentration in the renal medulla", 
                "urea is actively transported into Bowman's capsule from the glomerular capillaries"],
                correctAnswer: "urea is reabsorbed from the proximal tubule but at a lesser rate that water is reabsorbed",
                explanation: "Urea concentration increases in the fluid leaving the proximal tubule because it is reabsorbed more slowly than water, causing a relative concentration increase.",

                correctAnswer: "actively secreted into the tubule",
                explanation: "Penicillin is actively secreted into the proximal tubule, which is why it is rapidly excreted in urine.",

                correctAnswer: "urine",
                explanation: "Creatinine concentration is highest in urine because it is filtered but not reabsorbed or secreted, becoming more concentrated as water is reabsorbed along the nephron.",

                question: "Suppose a person loses the function of half his nephrons because of renal degenerative disease. Assuming the person survives and reaches a new steady state and that body urea production remains normal, which of the following would be expected to decrease below normal?",

                correctAnswer: "renal urea clearance",
                explanation: "With the loss of nephrons, renal urea clearance decreases because fewer nephrons are available to filter and excrete urea, even if plasma concentration increases.",

                correctAnswer: "rate of urine formation",
                explanation: "Stimulation of osmoreceptors increases ADH release, leading to more water reabsorption and decreased urine formation, so the rate of urine formation does not increase.",
